# Telescope Operations and Guidance Software

Welcome to the MINERVA software repository! This repository contains a comprehensive software package for operating and guiding the MINERVA telescope. The software offers powerful tools and functionalities to automate and streamline telescope operations, ensuring accurate and efficient observations of celestial objects.

## Features

- **Telescope Control**: The software provides a user-friendly interface for controlling telescope movements, including slewing, tracking, and pointing. It supports various telescope models and communication protocols, allowing seamless integration with different hardware setups.

- **Guidance and Tracking**: The software incorporates advanced algorithms and techniques for precise guidance and tracking of celestial objects. It utilizes sensor data, star catalogs, and astrometric calculations to ensure accurate positioning and smooth tracking during observations.

- **Scheduler and Planning**: With the built-in scheduler, you can plan and schedule observation sessions, define target lists, and automate telescope movements based on specific criteria such as object visibility, astronomical events, or user-defined schedules.

- **Image Acquisition and Processing**: The software enables image acquisition from the telescopes' detectors and provides a range of image processing tools for calibration, alignment, stacking, and enhancement. It supports various file formats and provides an intuitive interface for visualizing and analyzing acquired images.

- **Observation Data Management**: The software includes features for managing observation data, organizing acquired images and metadata, and associating them with specific observing sessions or projects. It facilitates data retrieval, searching, and archiving for future analysis.

## Usage
